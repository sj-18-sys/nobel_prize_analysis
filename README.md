# 🏅 Nobel Prize Analysis

An exploratory data analysis of Nobel Prize winners from 1901–2016, investigating award distribution by gender, nationality, age, and more.

##  Project Overview

This project explores the Nobel Prize dataset to uncover meaningful patterns and historical trends. It answers questions like:

- Who are the most frequent Nobel Prize–winning countries?
- How has gender representation evolved over time?
- Who was the first female laureate?
- What’s the age range of winners?
- Which laureates have won more than once?

The dataset merges multiple fields—category, name, gender, nationality, award year—so we can visualize and analyze across these dimensions.
